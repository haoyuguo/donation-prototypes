# Try Cypress out of the box

Now that we have Cypress installed, try to run it and see what happens.

From project root folder, run command

```./node_modules/.bin/cypress open```

Cypress GUI Console should now open, with a sample test file listed ```example_spec.js```.  Click on "Run All Tests" and see how it goes.
