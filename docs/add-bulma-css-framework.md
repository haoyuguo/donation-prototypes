# Add [Bulma CSS Framework](https://bulma.io/)

Bulma is pure CSS.  Comparing to Bootstrap, which includes Javascript components to help with some user interactions, Bulma leaves such things to the users, which could be desirable in some cases.

Follow [Bulma docs](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/), and things are pretty straightforward to set up.
