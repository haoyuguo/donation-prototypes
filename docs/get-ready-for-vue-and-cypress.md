# Get ready for Vue and Cypress

## Prerequisites

[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) is required.  This should already include ```npm```.

## Get dependencies for Vue

Starting at Laravel version 5.3, Vue.js is included in Laravel out of the box.  To get ready to use Vue, simply run ```npm install``` under project root directory. 

([Composing Laravel page with Vue](compose-laravel-page-with-vue.md) is introduced separately)

## Install Cypress

Simply run ```npm install cypress --save-dev``` under project root directory.

## Vue-devtools is recommended

When using Chrome browser, it's recommended to install ```vue-devtools``` extension.  This will add a new tab "Vue" in dev tools panel when displaying a Vue page.
